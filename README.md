Welcome to the Connection Pooling with HikariCP repository! This project showcases an example code implementation of
connection pooling using HikariCP, a high-performance JDBC connection pooling library. Connection pooling is a technique
used to efficiently manage and reuse database connections, improving the performance and scalability of database-driven
applications.

## Introduction

HikariCP is a lightweight and highly optimized connection pooling library for Java applications. It provides several
advantages over traditional connection pooling libraries, including faster connection acquisition and release, lower
memory footprint, and improved scalability.

This repository contains a sample code that demonstrates how to integrate HikariCP into your application for efficient
connection management with a relational database.

## Features

- Integration with popular JDBC drivers
- Fast connection acquisition and release
- Configurable connection pool settings
- Automatic connection health monitoring
- Connection timeout and validation mechanisms
- Support for connection pooling optimizations
- Easy integration with various Java frameworks and libraries

## Setup

To use HikariCP in your project, follow these steps:

1. Add the HikariCP dependency to your project's build configuration. The latest version can be found on
   the [HikariCP GitHub repository](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP).

2. Configure the HikariCP properties according to your database settings. You can customize parameters such as maximum
   pool size, connection timeout, and validation queries.

3. Create a `HikariDataSource` object using the configured properties.

4. Use the `HikariDataSource` object to obtain database connections in your application code.

Detailed setup instructions and configuration options can be found in
the [HikariCP documentation](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP#configuration-knobs-baby).

## Usage

The provided code demonstrates a basic usage of connection pooling with HikariCP. It includes examples of acquiring
connections from the pool, executing database operations, and releasing connections back to the pool.

To run the code:

1. Make sure you have the required dependencies and libraries set up in your Java project.

2. Modify the code to match your database configuration, including the connection URL, username, and password.

3. Execute the code and observe the console output, which demonstrates the connection pooling behavior and the execution
   of database operations.

Feel free to explore and customize the code to fit your specific requirements and integrate it into your own projects.
